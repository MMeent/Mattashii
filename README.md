Mattashii: Simulating Galaxies
=========

The Mattashii project is built to calculate one of the problems of the universe: signal delay. 

When I were searching for an programme that could give me the distance between two planets, as well as the signal delay between those, I didn't find any, what suprized me.
Then, after a while, I were stumbling around some simulation code for different planets, but it failed to simulate things correctly, for it put the sun as an solid, immovable object in the center of the universe, what it isn't.
Now I have developed an library, mattashii, and an GUI, mattashii_ui, to get this possible. The programme is still under development, with regular updates. It is written in python, and will be able to simulate a group of celestial objects.
